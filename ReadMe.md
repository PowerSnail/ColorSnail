ReadMe alpha v0.1
===

## Instructions

Color Snail applies user-friendly UI/UX. The tool is intuitively easy to utilize. 
To download the source code, please fork or clone the repository. I am more than willing to hear from users. Please open an issue or email me directly at hj5fb@virginia.edu if you prefer it. 
To download the executable only (the .exe you run), open the folder "Release [version number]" and download "ColorSnail.exe". This standalone executable should be able to run if .Net framework is installed properly on your machine.

### 1. Grab Color

To grab a color from anywhere on the screen, click the "Color Straw" button. You will see the text beside it instantly changes. Click anywhere you want on the screen, and the program will read the color at the pixel your mouse is resting. The color will be automatically added to the main list.

### 2. Use Color

To use the colors stored in the list, you can either 1). remember the color code displaying or 2). click on the square showing the color, during which the color code will be copied to your clipboard. You can put your caret at the place you need to insert the color code, and paste. Simple!

### 3. Other operations

Double click on the top bar, and you will be able to see the About and Credit information.
